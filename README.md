# RPFS_Budget_TWCT
m-machine Robust Permutation Flow Shop Problem under budgeted uncertainty, Total Weighted Completion Time Objective : Source code and experiment result files

## Instructions

### Instance files for Rob-PFSP-TWCT

* Instance files are located in the folder `instances/robust/ying/rob-pfsp-wct` of this repository. 
* Each subfolder containts the set of instance files of a different size. 
* Instance filenames use the following pattern: `RB<number_of_jobs_n>01<seq>_<number_of_jobs_n>_<number_of_machines_m>_<alpha>_wct_inputs.txt`. A detailed description of n, m, seq and alpha is presented below, in the experiments results description.


### Experimental results

All experimental results can be found in the Excel file `RPFS_TWCT_all_results.xlsx` located in the root folder of this repository.

Here's a brief description of each column:

* model: Robust-Counterpart (RC) model name used to solve the Master Problem (MP) inside the Column-and-Constraint (C&CG) algorithm (e.g., Liao-You). If `model` has the `Hybrid` suffix (e.g., Manne-Hybrid)), the Master Problem was solved using the hybrid solution approach, described in the paper (`Levorato et al. (2022)`).
* n: Number of jobs.
* m: Number of machines.
* alpha: $\alpha$ or $\alpha_{max}$ value used to generate the maximum allowed deviations in processing time values P_hat ($\widehat{P}$). 
* seq: sequential number depicting the basic `P_bar` nominal processing time matrix used to generate the instance.
* instance_type: type of instance generated (e.g., `ying` instances follow the generation recipe introduced by Ying (2015)).
* instance_name: instance filename (instances are located in the folder `instances/robust/ying/rob-pfsp-wct` of this repository). 
* RobCost_Gamma: budget parameter Gamma ($0 \leq \Gamma \leq mn$) value used to solve the instance. This parameter has a maximum value of $mn$ (number of operations).  
* Gamma%: relative budget parameter \% Gamma ($\% \Gamma$$) value used to solve the instance: $\% \Gamma = 100 \times \Gamma / (m \times n)$.
* wct: Total Weighted Completion Time (TWCT) value returned by the solution method. 
* permutation: the job permutation returned as solution.
* time: total time spent to solve the problem (includes Master Problem and Sub Problem solution times). 
* mp_total_time: total Master Problem solution time, in seconds.
* sp_total_time: total Sub Problem solution time, in seconds.
* iterations: number of Column-and-Constraint iterations performed.
* cut_count: total number of distinct scenarios generated by the sub problem and added as cuts to the Master Problem.
* lb: lower bound to the optimal TWCT solution value.
* cost: solution cost (TWCT) returned by the C\&CG solution method (serves as upper bound to the optimal solution value).
* gap: optimal solution gap value: $gap = (cost - lb)/lb$.
* optimal: indicates that the solution found is optimal or not (True of False).
